## Clockwise
DIY smart wall clock device

Clockwise was an idea I had while working with 64x64 LED matrices. These displays are about the size of a wall clock and with the ESP32, besides controlling the content presented on the display we also gain the functionality of WiFi, Bluetooth, touch buttons and other sensors, which gives us basically a smart wall clock. 
From there I started to develop a platform to create the _Clockfaces_, or skins that the clock can have. The possibilities are many and I hope that with help from contributors, we can grow the options even more.
